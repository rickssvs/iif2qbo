            <strong>YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO US.</strong> This Privacy Policy explains how the RO Writer IIF to QuickBooks Online Importer ("Software," "Application," or "we") handles your information. By using this Software, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>The RO Writer IIF to QuickBooks Online Importer is a locally-run application that helps you import financial data from RO Writer 3 into QuickBooks Online. This Software is designed with privacy as a core principle:</p>

            <li><strong>Local processing only:</strong> All file processing happens on your computer</li>
            <li><strong>Direct QuickBooks connection:</strong> Data goes directly from your computer to QuickBooks</li>
            <li><strong>No tracking or analytics:</strong> We do not track your usage or collect analytics</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>Rick's SVS Automotive LLC does NOT collect, store, or transmit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your financial data or IIF file contents</li>
            <li>Your QuickBooks Online credentials (username/password)</li>

            <li>IP addresses or device information</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>3. Information Stored Locally on Your Computer</h2>
        <p>The Software stores the following information in your web browser's localStorage (on your computer only):</p>
        
        <table>

            <strong>Important:</strong> All of this data is stored ONLY on your computer in your web browser. It is never transmitted to Rick's SVS Automotive LLC or any third party (except QuickBooks Online as needed for API authentication).
        </div>

        <h2>4. How Your Data is Processed</h2>
        <p>Here's exactly what happens when you use the Software:</p>

        <h3>4.1 OAuth Authentication</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>You click "Connect to QuickBooks" in the application</li>
            <li>You are redirected to Intuit's official OAuth login page (appcenter.intuit.com)</li>
            <li>You log in with your QuickBooks credentials directly on Intuit's website</li>
            <li>Intuit redirects you back to the application with a temporary authorization code</li>
            <li>The application exchanges this code for access tokens via a local PowerShell server running on your computer (localhost:8080)</li>
            <li>The tokens are stored in your browser's localStorage</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Your QuickBooks password never passes through our application.</strong></p>

        <h3>4.2 IIF File Processing</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>You select IIF files from your local file system</li>
            <li>The files are read directly in your browser using JavaScript</li>
            <li>The IIF data is parsed and converted to QuickBooks journal entry format</li>
            <li>The converted data is sent directly to QuickBooks Online via HTTPS</li>
            <li>No file data is stored permanently - it exists only in memory during processing</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4.3 Data Flow Diagram</h3>
        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>Your Computer</strong> → reads IIF files → parses locally → sends to → <strong>QuickBooks Online</strong><br>
            <br>
            <em>Rick's SVS Automotive LLC is NOT in this data flow. We never see your data.</em>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 Intuit QuickBooks Online</h3>
        <p>This Software integrates with QuickBooks Online, which is operated by Intuit Inc. When you use this Software:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your financial data is transmitted directly to QuickBooks Online via their API</li>
            <li>Intuit's Privacy Policy applies to how they handle your data: <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.intuit.com/privacy/</a></li>
            <li>We are not responsible for Intuit's data practices</li>
            <li>You should review Intuit's privacy policy and terms of service</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Local PowerShell Server</h3>
        <p>The Software uses a local PowerShell server (server.ps1) that runs on your computer at localhost:8080. This server:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Handles OAuth callbacks from Intuit</li>
            <li>Proxies API requests to QuickBooks to avoid CORS issues</li>
            <li>Runs entirely on your local machine</li>
            <li>Does not log or store any data</li>
            <li>Only accessible from your computer (localhost)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take the following measures to protect your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTTPS Encryption:</strong> All communication with QuickBooks Online is encrypted via HTTPS</li>
            <li><strong>OAuth 2.0:</strong> Industry-standard authentication protocol (no passwords stored)</li>
            <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Your financial data never leaves your computer except to go directly to QuickBooks</li>
            <li><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> We do not use any cloud services to process or store your data</li>
            <li><strong>Token Security:</strong> OAuth tokens are stored in browser localStorage, which is isolated per-origin</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your Responsibilities:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep your computer and browser secure</li>
            <li>Do not share your QuickBooks credentials with anyone</li>
            <li>Log out of QuickBooks when finished</li>
            <li>Use strong passwords for your QuickBooks account</li>
            <li>Clear browser data if using a shared computer</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Because we don't collect your data, we don't retain it. The only data stored is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>On your computer:</strong> OAuth tokens and import logs in browser localStorage</li>
            <li><strong>In QuickBooks:</strong> Journal entries you import (subject to Intuit's retention policies)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Delete Your Data:</h3>
        <p>To remove all locally stored data from the Software:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the application in your browser</li>
            <li>Open browser Developer Tools (F12)</li>
            <li>Go to "Application" or "Storage" tab</li>
            <li>Find "Local Storage" → "http://localhost:8080"</li>
            <li>Delete all items or clear entire localStorage</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternatively, clearing your browser's cache and data will remove all stored information.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>This Software is designed for business use and is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Because we don't collect or store your personal data, most data rights (access, deletion, portability) are not applicable. However:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Control:</strong> You have full control over all data stored locally on your computer</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Revoke Access:</strong> You can revoke this application's access to QuickBooks at any time through your QuickBooks account settings</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You can delete all locally stored data at any time (see Section 7)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, since we do not collect, sell, or share your personal information, most CCPA provisions do not apply to our use of this Software.</p>

        <h2>11. European Privacy Rights (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, since we do not process your personal data (all processing happens locally on your device), most GDPR provisions do not apply to our use of this Software.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting to this page. We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Software after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>13. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Since all data processing happens on your local computer and data is only transmitted to QuickBooks Online (operated by Intuit Inc.), there are no international data transfers initiated by Rick's SVS Automotive LLC.</p>
        <p>If you use QuickBooks Online from outside the United States, data transferred to QuickBooks may be subject to international transfer according to Intuit's policies.</p>

        <h2>14. Business Transfers</h2>
        <p>In the event that Rick's SVS Automotive LLC is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will ensure that any successor entity continues to honor this Privacy Policy. Since we do not collect user data, there would be no personal information to transfer.</p>
